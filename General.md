# General knowledge

## Interpreted vs Compiled
- Interpreted language - processed at run time, read and executed from top to bottom
- Compiled language - tranformed into another language or form before being run by the computer

## Server-side vs. Client-side
- Server-side - code that is run on a server, typically processing a request before sending back to the client (user)
- Client-side - code that is typically run on a user's computer (browser), may exist in another framework before being run and displayed by a browser

## Dynamic vs. Static code
- Dynamic - code able to display different content under different circumstances
- Static - code that shows the same content all the time

## API - Application Programming Interface
- Browser APIs:
  - The DOM API - allows for dynamic webpage manipulation
  - The Geolocation API - retrieves geographical information
  - Canvas and WebGL APIs - allows for creation of 2D and 3D graphics
  - Audio and video APIs - multimedia manipulation
- Third party APIs - not built into the browser, are obtained elsewhere
