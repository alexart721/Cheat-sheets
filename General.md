## Object-Oriented Programming
The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:
- Abstraction - Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system
- Encapsulation - Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions
- Inheritance - Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions
- Polymorphism - Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions

## Interpreted vs Compiled
- Interpreted language - processed at run time, read and executed from top to bottom
- Compiled language - transformed into another language or form before being run by the computer

------

## Server-side vs. Client-side

- Server-side - code that is run on a server, typically processing a request before sending back to the client (user)
- Client-side - code that is typically run on a user's computer (browser), may exist in another framework before being run and displayed by a browser

------

## Dynamic vs. Static code

- Dynamic - code able to display different content under different circumstances
- Static - code that shows the same content all the time

------

## API - Application Programming Interface

- Browser APIs:
  - The DOM API - allows for dynamic webpage manipulation
    - The DOM connects webpages to scripts or programming languages by representing documents in memory
    - The DOM represents documents with a tree data structure with each branch ending in a node and each node containing objects
  - The Geolocation API - retrieves geographical information
  - Canvas and WebGL APIs - allows for creation of 2D and 3D graphics
  - Audio and video APIs - multimedia manipulation
- Third party APIs - not built into the browser, are obtained elsewhere

## CRLF

- CR (Carriage Return) - returns the cursor to the beginning of the line, owes name to typewriter function
- LF (Line Feed) - moves to the next line, again has roots in typewriter function
- CRLF - combines above, cursor to the beginning of a new line
